Price Optimization Using Machine Learning
Welcome to the Price Optimization Repository, a machine learning-driven approach to optimizing pricing strategies for products and services. 

Overview
Price optimization is a crucial aspect of modern business strategy, involving the use of various factors such as competitor pricing, customer demands, market conditions, and customer profiles to set optimal prices. The goal is to find a balance that maximizes profits, improves customer satisfaction, and meets business objectives like sales growth and inventory management.

In this repository, we leverage machine learning techniques to analyze complex data and uncover pricing insights that traditional methods might miss. By applying advanced algorithms, we can predict the impact of different pricing strategies and identify the most profitable price points for each product.
